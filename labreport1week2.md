## Installing VSCode
***
In order to get [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you must first access the website by clicking on the hyperlink or searching it up on your web browser. Second, once you are on the site, there should be a download button; it should detect if you're on Mac, Windows, or Linux, but clicking on the arrow next to it should bring up different versions of installers that you can use for your operating system.
